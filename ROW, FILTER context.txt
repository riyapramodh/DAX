Calculations done within rows --> row context
Profit = Sumx(Sales, [sales] - [price])   ---> from sales table we are finding the "sales - price" value for each row and saving that in "profit"

Filter Context --> filters that are applied before the table arrives
that is before the values are calculated if no filter is applied we may have 1000 rows but after applying filter
through the filter pane, visual(clicking and selecting a part), slicer only those rows will be shown and acc the numbber of rows will also get lesser.


say we have a total sales of 28M 
FILTER 1 - once we add this to a table and add the states as well we see the split up for each state --- this is a filter that helps us to filter out based on the states
FILTER 2 - next we can add a filter by using a slicer that helps us to filter based on a product --> so now it filters sale for each state and based on product and hn=ence out total sales value may als vary now
this is FILTER CONTEXT
it is just a set of filters that have been applie to derive to the resukt
FILTER CONTEXT is the combintion of filters from all tables / filter tables


we need to use row context in cases such as -
say we want to find the profit by subtracting price from sales
if we subtract [total of price] from [total of sales] like how we do ususal calculations, the value here wont be accurate
its because price and sales for each product will vary and hence we must find the ndividual calculation for each row and then sum them up to gthere
so instead of -------------------> [total sales]-[total price]
we do -------------->  sumx([sales]-[ price])

SUMX ----> is an iterator that iterates through each row in the table
and these are measures
once we apply filter the calculation will be redone internally using the dax command we wrote and we will get a new value
and that is why a MEASURE is said to be dynamic
