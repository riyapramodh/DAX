so we have defaul functions that will help us with the objective
example
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('SALE'[date]) --> here the function has been used and the paraemtre is the data column of the SALE table
we go for CALCULATED TABLES when --> date tables, role playing dimensions, what-if analysis
in excel u can reference the indiviudual cells or arrays but in DAX  we can omly reference the tables or columns
not all data types supported by excel will be supported by DAX


syntax :
MEASURE = FUNCTION('TABLE'[COLUMN])
Total sale = Sum('SALES'[revenue])

to make a new colunmn using DAX but it needs to be made combining two pre existing columns then we may use as (with a hyphen between the two values) :
New product name = productHeirarchy[prod_id] & "-"& productHeirarchy[product_name]

only those with measures (sigmoid/sogma sign)
the code that we write to calculate like Total sales etc can be seen when we drag and drop , so itll only be visble in the table in the visualisation page
but if we go to the table view it wouldnt be visble in the table column 
cuz the code or its result is not stored in definite memory , just can be seen and used ONLY FOR CREATING VISUALISATIONS

also if we have say used Total sales in 100 visuals m instead of changing in all the 100 places from total sales to trotal profit , we can just alter it in the dax code adn it gets changed automatically
-----the main reason for using DAX coding


for writting aggregation/summation/etc we go for MEASURE
for concatention/column derivation/etc we go for CALCULATED COLUMNS

the MEASURE is visble only when we use it in a visual ; else it isnt stored any where else
also when we click on columsn with SUMMATION symbol go to the Column Tools and from Summarisation (it ll be given as SUM by default) change it to -->DONT SUMMARISE


CALCULATED TABLE
we can create a tbale with just the values we need --> basically like filtering a pre existing table and storing the filtered values onto a new table

new table = DateTable //repeats the same table -- has all dates info such as due date, sale date , etc 
//our goal is to create a new table that just relates and filters the due date alone --> due date dimension table to link with the feild table
new table = CALENDER(DATE(2020,1,1),DATE(2021,12,31))  ----> c
CALENDER function ---> takes start date and end date
DATE function within that ---> takes date as year month date
so here it is a function within a function to create a single column in anew table

now to get the year aloen from this column of the table and add to a new column :
Datetable = CALENDER(DATE(2020,1,1),DATE(2021,12,31))
Year = YEAR(DateTable[DATE])
--> Here "Year" is the column name we give and "YEAR" is the function used to obtain just the years from the "DATE" column of the "Datetable"
--> when we dont use measure we DONT have to wrap the tablename around single qoutes('')
