CALCULATE DAX FUNCTION ---->
evaluates  an expression in a context modifed by filters
basically we can evaluate a value but als use inuilt columns
also if filter sare applied in thsi command then the pre applied filters will be ignored and only these filters will be effective


total healthcare sales = CALCULATE(
                        SUM('sales'[price]),                                    -----------> the expression to evaluate
                        'productHeirarchy'[caetgory] = "Hygeine"                -----------> the filter that will be applied (all other pre applied filters will be neglected)
                        )

                                            ELSE ALSO WRITTEN AS 
total product sales = CALCULATE(
                        SUM('sales'[price]),                                    
                        All('productHeirarchy'[caetgory])               
                        )
this can be done to compre between values of sales of different categories
so here we may say that if in a table we add both healthcare and total sales, then in this manner for each of the total sales fro every category we can compare with tthat of the healthcare category
it may also have many other uses


now to find difference in sales bewtwwen two categories -----?

DIFF_SALES = [total healthcare sales] - 'sales'[total sales] 
---> here we dont mention the table name for "total healthcare sales" cuz this is a measure and it is not any column that belongs to a table
so this if we add as a column it gives the diff in sales of each category compared with the healthcare sales for each row entry



-to find th epercentage contribution of each country to the tital sales
all_country_sales = CALCULATE(SUM('sales'[total_sales]), All('sales_city'[state])) ----------------------> gives us that total sales of each state with the final amount
share_Contributoin = 'sales'[total_sales]/'measures_table'[all_country_sales] ---------------------------> then click on the % symbol to get in that format
now you may add this to the table and we may see alongside each othe country rows the contribution it has mad ein terms of percentage to the total sales


we use [only need to use this] CALCULATE when we need to do some calculation that require to override the filter context , so even if some filters are present for the usage of the measur ethey would be neglected
